# Personal Profile Webpage

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple, responsive personal profile webpage using fundamental web technologies.

* **Objective:**
    * To build a single web page showcasing a personal profile (name, photo, introduction).
    * To include a functional contact form.
    * To implement a JavaScript-powered interactive greeting button.
    * To apply visual styling for an appealing user interface.

* **Tools Used:**
    * **HTML5:** For structuring the content of the webpage.
    * **CSS3:** For styling the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
    * **JavaScript (ES6+):** For adding interactive elements, specifically the greeting functionality.

* **Steps Included:**
    1.  **HTML Structure:** Created the basic page layout, including headings, an image tag for the profile photo, an introductory paragraph, and a contact form with input fields and a submit button.
    2.  **CSS Styling:** Applied a light blue background color, styled the main heading, added borders and padding to the profile section and contact form, and ensured proper spacing for readability. The profile photo was styled as a square with rounded corners.
    3.  **JavaScript Interaction:** Implemented a "Say Hello" button that, when clicked, prompts the user for their name and then displays a personalized greeting in a pop-up alert box.

* **Features Included:**
    * Dynamic "Welcome to My Profile Page" heading.
    * Dedicated section for profile photo and self-introduction.
    * Interactive "Say Hello" button with user input.
    * Fully functional contact form (Name, Email, Message, Submit).
    * Clean and responsive design with consistent visual styling.

* **Key Insights / Learning Points:**
    * Understanding the separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for style, JavaScript for behavior).
    * Basic DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation to add interactivity.
    * Applying fundamental CSS properties for layout, spacing, and visual aesthetics.
    * Handling user input via `prompt()` and displaying output via `alert()`.
    * Creating a single-file HTML solution by embedding CSS and JavaScript.

* **Conclusion:**
    This project successfully delivers a basic yet complete personal profile webpage, demonstrating core web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a foundational example for creating interactive and visually appealing web presences.
